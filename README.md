# Kyara Beverages

## Overview

This project is a static, responsive homepage for Kyara Beverages, built as part of a Web Developer Intern application task. It features a hero banner with a parallax effect, an about section with a watercolor texture, a contact form, and a footer. The design is styled with plain CSS to reflect the brand's fresh, authentic, and user-centric ethos.

## How to Open and View Locally

1. **Clone or Download** the project folder to your local machine.
2. Ensure the following folder structure is maintained:
   - `index.html`: The main HTML file.
   - `styles.css`: The CSS file for styling.
   - `images/` (placeholder): Directory for images (logo and product images are referenced but not included).
3. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) in one of the following ways:
   - **Option 1**: Double-click `index.html` to open it directly in your default browser.
   - **Option 2**: Use a local server for a better experience (recommended):
     - If you have VS Code, install the "Live Server" extension and right-click `index.html` to select "Open with Live Server."
4. The page should load and be fully responsive across devices. Scroll to see the parallax effect in the hero section and hover over product cards for interactive effects.

## Tools and Frameworks Used

- **HTML**: Used for the page structure, providing a semantic and accessible foundation for the homepage.
- **Plain CSS**: Chosen for styling as per the requirement to avoid frameworks like Tailwind or Bootstrap. Plain CSS allowed for complete control over the design, including custom animations (e.g., floating shapes, hover effects) and textures (e.g., watercolor grain in the About section). Media queries ensure responsiveness across screen sizes.
- **Google Fonts**: Integrated Montserrat (for headings) and Lato (for body text) to match the typography identified in the job posting image, enhancing the brand's visual identity.
- **No JavaScript**: Since this is a static page with no form processing or complex interactivity, JavaScript was not required.
- **SVG for Textures and Shapes**: Used inline SVGs for background textures (e.g., watercolor grain, circles) and decorative shapes (e.g., floating blobs in the hero section) to add a playful, beverage-themed aesthetic without external dependencies.

## Why These Tools?

- **Plain CSS over Frameworks**: The requirement specified using plain CSS or a framework like Tailwind/Bootstrap. I chose plain CSS to demonstrate a deeper understanding of styling fundamentals, allowing for precise customization of animations, textures, and responsive design without relying on pre-built utilities.
- **Google Fonts**: Montserrat and Lato were selected to align with the typography identified in the job posting image, ensuring the design reflects Kyaraâ€™s modern and fresh brand ethos.
- **SVG Usage**: Inline SVGs were used for textures and shapes to keep the page lightweight and dependency-free, while adding visual flair that matches the beverage theme (e.g., bubbles, watercolor effects).
